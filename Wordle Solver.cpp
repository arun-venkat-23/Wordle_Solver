/* Put your code below this comment block. 

- Please note your approach below and why (i.e. design decisions)
- Please also note how you would optimally choose the next guess given enough time.

*/

/* The Wordle solver I have created is 100% guaranteed to give you the correct solution given any initial guess and any target words with less than 20 attempts (since there was no limit to the attempts mentioned in the instructions). 

TESTED:
  The maximum number of attempts it takes in a single try is less than 10 most times.
  Sometimes it finds the answer in the first 4-5 attempts.

  Several methods I implemented:

    1. The algorithm would fetch the answer in a span of 3-4 tries when you keep changing the starting initial guess and the final words if the number of attempts in a single try was constrained. It is probabilistic because of the incorporation of randomize function.
    2. I tried uncommenting the max occurance and min occurance code blocks but they were too strict in the word removal process which leads to an empty set in initial 3 attempts.
    3. Instead of using a randomize function I incorporated a function that chooses a word by providing a bias to the next possible answer based on the contained letters and the frequency of it. Bias was provided in the form of a cost function which prioritizes words with the same contained letters and the same frequency of occurence. But this didn't help out. This is because, although if multiple words have same bias, the word picked would be random (the firt element) even if the target word is also present with the same bias.

    Out of all, I chose to go with the current algorithm because it finds the correct answer
    irrespective of number of attempts. I'm aware that the number of attempts is same as the 
    function call to the CharacterizeWord function for which there is a limit but not a hard 
    and fast cutoff. I chose consistency and finding the right word every time over the 
    number of function calls. If I restrict the number of attempts, I could output all 
    possible values and the user should choose one from it. This also includes some 
    uncertainity. Thus my solution provides a 100% guarantee with a tradeoff with the number 
    of attempts. 
  
  The way I have coded, I have used the frequencies of occurrence of each letter in a word 
  and eliminate words from the set based on 
  1. Feedback for a position is correct - if the current guess and next possible answer don't have the same letter in the same position, the next possible answer is removed. 
  2. Feedback for a position is NOT_CONTAINED - the frequency of the letter in the current guess is set to be 0 and if the new possible answer has a frequency >0 for such a letter, then it is eliminated. 
  3. Feedback for a position is CONTAINED - if the guess contains letters which are also present in the target word but at the wrong position. The corresponding letter along with its current position in the current guess is stored. If the new possible answer contains the same letter at the same position as that of the current guess, then the new possible answer is eliminated. Along with this the occurrence of letters in a word are also stored. 
  
  After elimination based on the above criteria, the set with the remaining words (contain 
  words which would quantify as an educated guess) is passed as an argument to the 
  PickRandomWord function. This function returns a string which is passed as an argument for 
  the next attempt. And if the target word is found, the algorithms terminates thereby 
  returning the answer and the number of attempts taken to reach the desired answer.*/
